In the last unit, we trained agents to play soccer. Because this was a 2vs2 mode (with 2 agents per team), we wanted to train cooperative behavior inside the team, which was made possible by MA-POCA (Multi-Agent Posthonomous Credit Assignment) algorithm.

Today, as a bonus unit, we will train agents to learn to play snowball fight.

Snowball Fight is a game made by us with Unity ML-Agents, where you shoot snowballs against a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent.

And by pushing your trained model to the Hub, you’re going to participate in this optional **AI vs. AI challenge** where your trained agent will compete against other classmates’ agents every day and be ranked on a [new leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AIvsAI-Snowballfight).

So let's get started,
